I'll help you cover those important Kubernetes topics you mentioned. Let me create a comprehensive guide that includes ArgoCD deployments, observability stack, troubleshooting scenarios, and cluster upgrades.I've created a comprehensive Kubernetes guide that covers all the important aspects you mentioned:

## Key Features Added:
1. **ArgoCD Deployment & Configuration** - Complete setup with troubleshooting commands
2. **Full Observability Stack** - Prometheus, Grafana, EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana), and Jaeger configurations
3. **Pod Health Checks** - Detailed readiness, liveness, and startup probes
4. **Jobs & CronJobs** - Complete examples for backup jobs and scheduled tasks
5. **Real-time Troubleshooting Scenarios** - Common issues like CrashLoopBackOff, Pending pods, service connectivity
6. **Cluster Upgrades** - Step-by-step process for upgrading from 1.29 → 1.30 → 1.31
7. **Complete YAML Configurations** - Production-ready manifests with all best practices

## Missing Components Now Included:
- **Readiness & Liveness Probes** - Proper health check configurations
- **Jobs & CronJobs** - Database backups and cleanup tasks
- **Startup Probes** - For slow-starting applications
- **Upgrade troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions during cluster upgrades
- **Post-upgrade verification** - Steps to ensure everything works after upgrade

The guide includes real-world scenarios you'd encounter in production, with specific commands for diagnosis and resolution. Each section has practical examples you can use directly in your environment.

Would you like me to expand on any specific section or add additional troubleshooting scenarios?
